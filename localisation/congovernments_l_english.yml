 vassal_republic: "Vassal Republic"
 vassal_republic_desc: "The idea of Lhemitic vassal republics were first drafted by military scribes in Miti during 1166 as a means of lessening the dynastic authority of its vassals. Being shaped from the early republican government of Saki, it shares many similarities, however vassal republics retain their dynastic ties to some extent. In 1167 the first vassal republic was created in Susoqri and after its huge success, was swiftly implemented in other autonomous regions within Miti. This led to the common tradition among Lhemitic countries where new subjects and vassals would be expected to hold elections every decade, and it's been that way until recently."
